# Hi, I'm Celestino ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about programming and Machine Learning, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and share knowledge. I actively contribute to open-source projects, notably with [AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon) and [PyCaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret).

If you need help with a project or want to explore new ideas together, feel free to reach out!
